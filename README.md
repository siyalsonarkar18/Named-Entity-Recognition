# Named-Entity-Recognition

A Natural Language Processing platform was created to recognize named entities on Twitter dataset with Bi-directional LSTMs trained using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which extracted entities from text such as names of people, laces and organizations. Implemented prefix scheme called BIO markup for distinguishing consequent entities with similar types using Tensorflow and Keras.
